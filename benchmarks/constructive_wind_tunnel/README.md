# constructive_wind_tunnel

Wind-tunnel scenarios for the constructive geometry head, following the
workspace convention: argv-selected profiles, one `key=value` summary line
per run, and a signature-determinism assertion *before* any timing — the
wind tunnel is a determinism regression oracle first and a perf harness
second.

**CT-1** compiles and evaluates a batch of parameterized rounded-profile
extrusion recipes (arcs exercise the libm discretization path), asserts
bit-identical trimesh signatures across two full passes, exercises
source-map forward/reverse lookups at scale, and reports timing plus
introspection counters.

```sh
cargo run --release -p constructive_wind_tunnel -- --quick
cargo run --release -p constructive_wind_tunnel -- --ct1-stress
```
