# constructive_wind_tunnel

Wind-tunnel scenarios for the constructive geometry head, following the
workspace convention: argv-selected profiles, one `key=value` summary line
per run, and a signature-determinism assertion *before* any timing — the
wind tunnel is a determinism regression oracle first and a perf harness
second.

**CT-1** compiles and evaluates a batch of parameterized rounded-profile
extrusion recipes (arcs exercise the libm discretization path), asserts
bit-identical trimesh signatures across two full passes, exercises
source-map forward/reverse lookups at scale, and reports timing plus
introspection counters.

**CT-2** compares a cold grouped-recipe rebuild with a one-node edit through
the evaluation cache, while pinning the warm result against a full rebuild.

**CT-3** mirrors both gallery drill paths: the public constructive CSG card and
the direct 16-sided mesh Boolean used by the rounded-drill export. It isolates
constructive evaluation, direct Boolean, sharp-edge rounding, and render
extraction; deep-validates and signature-checks every result before timing;
then reports best and average phase times with Boolean/rounding work counters.
